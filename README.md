# Feature-engineering-handling-mixed-variables
I created new features by separating the numerical and categorical parts from existing features. This approach enhances feature engineering by enabling tailored transformations for each data type, optimizing how the data is processed and utilized in modeling. It improves model interpretability by clarifying the distinct contributions of numerical and categorical components to predictions, which helps in understanding the underlying factors influencing outcomes. This method enhances the flexibility of data preprocessing and supports more effective modeling strategies, contributing to more accurate and insightful analyses overall.
